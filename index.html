    <h2 class="about"> About Me</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Lori Henderson and I am 26 years old.
        I was born and raised in Indiana.
        I have a younger brother in college and an adopted beagle/pug mix named Spike.
        I love traveling and been to many interesting places.
        Despite that, I love doing nothing at home and relaxing with my dog or going on walks.
        I love anime and Pok√©mon especially.  Looking forward to starting Flatiron School shortly
        and meeting some great people.
